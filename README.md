# CSS-my-web-page

Hello and welocme to my very first styled web page. I know, it is just only beginner´s work, but if you want, please review the code and let me know what do you think.
I´ve done this within 2 weeks of learning HTML and CSS. 
Now I dived more deeply into HTML and CSS rules (I am going through MDN docs) and I will contine with Bootstrap.
Then it is finally time to go for JavaScript!
